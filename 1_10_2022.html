            <p>After six years, Overwatch will be shutting down. In its place will be the shiny new sequel, Overwatch 2.
                Despite a slew of development issues and points of confusion, the game still holds a lot of fun. With
                the release of Overwatch 2 just around the corner, here is everything you need to know about when the
                game officially launches, how to pre-load, and when the original Overwatch shuts down for good.
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <b>When will Overwatch 2 be released?</b>

            <p>Overwatch 2 will be launching on October 4, 2022, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series
                consoles, Nintendo Switch, and PC. An in-game message in the original Overwatch states that “servers
                should begin to come back online on October 4, 2022, 11 a.m. Pacific.” So, unofficially, the sequel may
                be up and running as early as 2 p.m. Eastern. Officially, however, the exact launch time of the game is
                as follows:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>US East Coast: 3 p.m. Eastern</li>
                <li>US West Coast: 12 p.m. Pacific</li>
                <li>UK: 8 p.m. BST</li>
                <li>EU: 9 p.m. CEST</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some regions will unlock on October 5, as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Korea: 4 am KST</li>
                <li>Australia: 6 am AEDT</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>

            <b>When can you pre-load Overwatch 2?</b>

            <p>PC players can pre-load Overwatch 2 through the Battle.net client right now. If you have enabled
                automatic updates, you might have pre-loaded it without knowing. If not, head to the Overwatch page in
                Battle.net and click the gear icon next to the “Play” button. Click it and check for updates. Once the
                update is downloaded you should see a message that reads “Pre-release content downloaded.” The install
                size of Overwatch 2 on PC is about 50 GB, so clear out any space ahead of time if you need it.
                On consoles, the Overwatch 2 install size is around 30 GB. Console pre-load starts about three hours
                before the full launch of the game.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>US West Coast: 9 a.m. Pacific</li>
                <li>United States East Coast: 12 p.m. Eastern</li>
                <li>UK: 5 p.m. BST</li>
                <li>EU: 6 p.m. CEST</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <b>When does Overwatch 1 shut down?</b>

            <p>Overwatch 2 will be replacing the first Overwatch game when it goes live. The servers for Overwatch 1
                will be shut down on Monday, October 3. The exact times that Overwatch 1 servers will shut down are the
                same times as the start to pre-loading Overwatch 2.
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>Do Overwatch credits transfer to Overwatch 2?</b>

            <p>Players who have put countless hours into the original Overwatch hope that their hard-earned
                currencies will transfer over to the sequel. And the answer is yes, with a catch.

                Blizzard confirmed in late June 2022 that all currencies from Overwatch will be transfered over to the
                sequel, including Credits, OWL tokens, and competitive points.

                However, Overwatch Commercial Lead Jon Spector shared that “our new virtual currency will be the main
                currency, and there will be things in OW2 that will not be purchasable with those OW1 credits.” Meaning
                that even though currency will transfer, it may not be of much use.
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>Do Overwatch cosmetics transfer to OVerwatch 2?</b>

            <p>Unlike Overwatch currency, players of the original game can rest easy when it comes to cosmetics.
                Everything from skins, sprays, and voice lines will transfer over to Overwatch 2. On PC this is an
                automatic thing, just load up Overwatch 2 and see all your pretty items.
            </p>

            <p>As for console players will need to merge their console account with a Battle.net account. To do this
                follow these steps:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Log in to Overwatch from your console account.</li>
                <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to scan a QR Code on your mobile phone.</li>
                <li>Enter the code displayed on your console to connect to or create your Blizzard Battle.net Account.
                </li>
                <li>Once complete, you will be prompted to confirm your account upon the next game login to merge your
                    accounts.</li>
            </ol>
