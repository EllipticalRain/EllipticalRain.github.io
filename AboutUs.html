                DoublePunch was launched in April 2020 with the goal of reporting on the gaming industry from the view
                of ordinary gamers. DoublePunch wants to be able to report on the gaming industry objectively without
                bias, all while entertaining our readers at the same time.
            </p>

                Founders Sam Fisher and Gordon Freeman are college buddies who love to play games together, but felt
                that current reporting on the gaming industry was missing something. It was missing the objectiveness
                that regular news reporting cherishes so deeply. So Sam and Gordon set out to cover news in the gaming
                industry that was to the same standard as mainstream news such as the Associated Press and
                the BBC. DoublePunch strives for quality reporting that informs ordinary gamers on information that
                deserves to be seen by them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two years later, this spontaneous decision during Spring Break in the middle of a pandemic has proven a
                success story for two college roomates. DoublePunch became an instant hit and is now a recogizable name
                in the gaming industry and among ordinary gamers looking for news on the next game or looking for
                tutorials in long cherished titles.

            <b>Gordon Freeman (Founder and Editor)</b>

            <p>
                The first founder. Leads DoublePunch as Editor (actually Overlord). When he's not spending time
                reporting on the latest news, he spends his time complaining that all Priest mains in Hearthstone are
                degenerates and raiding in Destiny 2.

            <br>

            <b>Sam Fisher (Founder and Writer)</b>

            <p>
                The second founder. A hardcore FPS enthusiast, can 1v5 in pretty much any round-based FPS. Your one-stop
                library to the history of Easter Eggs since 1997, probably waiting for the next Splinter Cell to come
                out.

            <b>Tyler Toney (Writer)</b>

            <p>
                Expert in sports video games, mostly FIFA and NBA 2K. Doesn't actually play sports, but he's the best at
                basketball, despite his height. (Trust me)

            <p>
                DoublePunch's King Of Cringe. Excellent record at winning any game just by cringing his opponent into
                quitting.
