                On Sunday, September 18, a massive and unprecedented leak hit one of the most anticipated games of the
                decade. Dozens of video files related to Grand Theft Auto 6 began appearing on fan forum GTAForums,
                giving the world a first — extremely unintended — look at Rockstar's next AAA game.
            </p>

            <p>
                The leak has caused a massive fallout, kickstarting a discussion about leaks within the video game
                industry and how they affect every level of game development. While the story of the GTA 6 leaks will
                continue, here's everything you need to know about the saga so far.
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>GTA 6 Confirmed, But Never Shown</b>

            <p>
                Rockstar officially announced the next Grand Theft Auto game on February 4, 2022, in a press release.
                “[W]e are pleased to confirm that active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series
                is well underway,” Rockstar wrote earlier this year. “We look forward to sharing more as soon as we are
                ready, so please stay tuned to the Rockstar Newswire for official details.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Before the announcement, Rockstar mainly discussed the ongoing success of Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA
                Online, both of which were receiving next-gen updates. While undoubtedly still popular, continuing to
                hype a decade-old game was wearing thin for some fans and the announcement of the next GTA game felt
                long overdue.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, with the announcement coming from a press release with no additional materials, it seemed that
                GTA 6 was still early in development. Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive and its CEO Strauss
                Zelnick followed up by saying more of GTA 6 would be shared on “Rockstar's schedule.” This did not
                happen.
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>The Leaks Begin: 'Here are 90 Footage/clips From GTA 6'</b>

            <p>
                GTAForums is one of the most popular online discussion boards to talk about all things Grand Theft Auto.
                On September 18, it became an unexpected home to leaked assets from the still-in-development Grand Theft
                Auto 6. The leaks quickly spread to other social media sites like Twitter and YouTube.
            </p>

            <p>
                Various clips, with unfinished assets, showed off several elements of the game in development including
                parts of the world, gunplay, and NPC AI. The clips also seemingly confirmed some rumors about GTA 6 that
                were already spreading online, such as the existence of male and female protagonists.
            </p>

            <p>
                The leak was from a user named “teapotuberhacker” who also claimed to be the same person who hacked the
                ride-hailing app Uber earlier this month. “Here are 90 footage/clips from GTA 6,” they wrote. The hacker
                also shared what looks to be various GTA 6 assets, and code from the game.
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>The Takedowns Begin</b>

            <p>
                Later that same day, leaked videos on multiple platforms were removed at the request of Take-Two
                Interactive. As reported by VGC, takedown requests appeared to come from individuals with Rockstar email
                addresses, all but confirming that the leaks were legitimate.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next day, both GTAForums and the GTA 6 subreddit removed threads featuring the leaked content.
                Messages on both sites explained that they were complying with requests from Take-Two to remove any and
                all copyrighted material. The original GTAForums thread was later reinstated, albeit locked for new
                comments, and with all links to stolen material removed.
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>Rockstar Officially Confirms the Hack</b>

            <p>
                In a surprising move, Rockstar confirmed the veracity of the hack, which until then was still being
                touted by some as a very elaborate hoax. Stating that “We recently suffered a network intrusion in which
                an unauthorized third party illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from our systems,
                including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Rockstar also reassured fans that despite the extensive leaks the studio did not anticipate any
                disruption or “long-term effect on the development” of its ongoing projects. Work on the next Grand
                Theft Auto game would also “continue as planned.”
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>The FBI Are Involved</b>

            <p>
                Given the extensive nature of the hacks and also that the reported victims aren't one but two major
                companies, the FBI has gotten involved in an investigation over the hacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Uber released a blog that revealed it was working with the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice to
                investigate the recent data breaches, and mentioned that their hacker was suspected to be involved in
                the Rockstar hack too. Uber revealed that it believes the hacker or hackers to be associated with a
                group known as Lapsus$ which has carried out similar attacks on companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and
                Samsung.
            </p>

            <p>
                “We believe this attacker (or attackers) are affiliated with a hacking group called Lapsus$, which has
                been increasingly active over the last year or so.” Uber cites similar techniques used by the hacking
                group on major tech companies as reasons for their suspicion.
            </p>

            <p>
                “There are also reports over the weekend that this same actor breached video game maker Rockstar Games,”
                Uber writes. “We are in close coordination with the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice on this matter
                and will continue to support their efforts.”
            </p>

            <br>

            <b>The Fallout of the GTA 6 Leaks</b>

            <p>
                While we're only a few days removed from the leaks, the episode has generated much discussion within the
                video game industry.
            </p>

            <p>
                One such discussion is the harm of sharing such early footage of a game, and how that might affect the
                perception of the final product. While the next Grand Theft Auto game is still early in development,
                popular understanding of game development is still lacking and this could have negative consequences on
                the game's final version.
            </p>

            <p>
                “My thoughts are with the team at [Rockstar Games],” wrote Xbox's Sarah Bond. “It can be disheartening
                to have a project you've worked hard on to delight fans revealed and critiqued before it's ready.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted the possible effects the leak might have on employees, and how it might
                “limit work-from-home flexibility.”
            </p>

            <p>
                As far as the early footage is concerned, there's been pushback against any early judgment on a work
                still in progress.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Anyone judging the leaked footage of [GTA 6] like an idiot clearly hasn't worked in game development,”
                writes game developer Cliff Bleszinski. “The amount of hours/people/dollars that goes into these games
                [equals] insane.”
            </p>

            <p>
                One way game developers have begun to combat and educate what an in-development version of a game looks
                like is to share footage from their games early in the development cycle. Developers from Insomniac,
                Remedy, and more shared early footage of games like Control, Spider-Man, and more to illustrate what
                early game development looks like, even for AAA projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                The caveat here is that the leaked GTA 6 footage looks pretty good considering how early game the game
                is in development. And some developers are broadening the scope of how early a game can be shown such as
                EA Motive which has been sharing very early looks at the upcoming Dead Space remake, while heavily
                emphasizing that everything they're sharing is still quite early.
            </p>

            <p>
                But if more gamers gain deeper insight and context into game development, even for AAA games, then
                perhaps there's at least one benefit from this episode.
            </p>

            <p>
                We won't know the full effects of the leak on the development of Grand Theft Auto 6 or Rockstar Games
                for some time. While any possible consequences might not reveal themselves for years, this will still go
                down as one of the biggest leaks in video game history, and possibly the entertainment industry as a
                whole.
